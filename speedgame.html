								<h2>About Speed Game</h2>
								<p>This was a final group project for a client. Our group name was Redacted. 
									We were tasked to create a web based card game application using MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js. 
									The application was a Speed Game and a California Speed Game. 
									This application would consist of a login page, a lobby, chat messaging, 
									and a breakout game room where users may join to play. This  project combined 
									all previous technologies into a single cohesive speed game application.
								</p>

								<h2>Criteria</h2>
								<p>A backend implementation of a standard 52 card deck. 
									<br>Basic emoting with predetermined messages.
									<br>Clients on the frontend must send a basic message to the backend server, and that backend message is sent to other frontend users.
									<br>Sending game state data from the backend to two frontend client users.
									<br>The login system
									<br>Ensure passwords are hashed with salt on the server end.
									<br>A functioning main chat room.
									<br>The start of gameplay of Classic Speed.The process works as follows:
									<br>Upon a second player joining a game, both players must each push a button or somehow signal they are ready to start. (Each player should see if the other player has signaled to start.)
									<br>Only when both players have signaled will the game supply a countdown timer of 3 seconds.
									<br>After those three seconds, deal cards into appropriate piles and seen by appropriate players.									
								</p>
